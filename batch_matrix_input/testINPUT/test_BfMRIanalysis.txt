pls		3		% PLS Option (between 1 to 6, see above notes)

%  Mean-Centering Type:
%    0. Remove group condition means from conditon means within each group
%    1. Remove grand condition means from each group condition mean
%    2. Remove grand mean over all subjects and conditions
%    3. Remove all main effects by subtracting condition and group means

%  Correlation Mode:
%    0. Pearson correlation
%    2. covariance
%    4. cosine angle

%  Notes: If you don't need to deselect conditions, just leave
%  "selected_cond" and "selected_bcond" to be commented.

%  First put k number of 1 after "selected_cond" keyword, where k is the
%  number of conditions in sessiondata file. Then, replace with 0 for
%  those conditions that you would like to deselect for any case except
%  behavior block of multiblock PLS. e.g. If you have 3 conditions in
%  sessiondata file, and you would like to deselect the 2nd condition,
%  then you should enter 1 0 1 after selected_cond.
